        "Description": "They had planned a life, but fate planned a funeral. Waiter Thomas Ferrero poisoned a drink meant for a 19-year-old student. After he died, his girlfriend, Vespera, shattered by loss, could only feel the weight of a future stolen. She had once dreamed of a wedding, a lifetime. Now, as the twilight of her heart settled into the darkness of her grief, Vespera knew her own light had dimmed forever. She buried her heart with himâ€”and what lived on was not love, but the cold, steady shape of revenge.",
