He is wanted by Interpol for stealing dozens of paintings from the Louvre during a private exhibition to which he was invited. Unfortunately, he managed to escape and sell the artworks before being identified. We now know he is hiding in Dubai and will be attending the opening of Lucy Philips&apos; exhibition. Since Interpol cannot act there, the museum director has turned to us to ensure his death as a form of consolation",
