Bourque was once a rising star in the fashion world, using his talent as a stylist to work with A-list celebrities and powerful politicians. However, his success was built on more than just his eye for designâ€”Bourque was also a master manipulator, using his access to the rich and famous to gather incriminating secrets. His criminal record began with small-time scams, like stealing luxury goods during fittings, but escalated when he became involved in a blackmail ring, using compromising photos and information to extort money from his high-profile clients. After a close call with the law, Bourque laid low for a few years, reinventing himself as a &quot;clean&quot; stylist. But his past is always just one phone call away, and the dangerous people he once worked with are still watching, ready to drag him back into the game. Because of this, our client wants him gone. \rGood luck, 47.",
