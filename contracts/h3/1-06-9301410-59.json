Aamir has been hooked to the needle for little over a year now, &amp; will do anything to get the money to keep from getting sick from withdrawls, feeding his habit by stealing from his co-workers families.  Now one of those victims has figured out Aamirs involvement in his missing property, &amp; thinking that a guard for his nations consulate may just get a slap on the wrist? They called us. Good Luck",
