When his heartbeat stopped, he was almost immediately transferred to GAMA and resuscitated. After surviving two assassination attempts, he went into hiding. A lousy attempt, as his social footprint and enormous financial &quot;misdoings&quot; has allowed us to easily pinpoint him. KEPNOR has yet to be informed, and it would be best to keep it that way.\r\rICA&apos;s reputation is at stake, 47.",
