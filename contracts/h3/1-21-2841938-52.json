        "Description": "Good evening, 47. Your targets are Tim and Ella Coleman. The mother-son duo both own Racun, a company which specializes in the fabrication and laundering of deadly substances. Recently the company has been working on a new concoction, which combines both arsenic and cyanide in order to wreak havoc on one’s body in just a few seconds, leaving the person no possibility for medical attention or recovery. The new breakthrough could lead to the company’s exposure if word got out, which is why in order to stay hidden, Ella’s son Tim has been working as a custodian on the Isle of Sgail while Ella has remained at the Racun manufacturing facility in Indonesia.\r\rHowever, just a few hours ago, Ella flew onto the Isle of Sgail via helicopter to deliver a vial of the new poisonous serum to her son. In order to be discreet she stuffed it into a bag of gunpowder and placed it at the top of the keep. She is planning on departing very shortly, which is why you need to act fast.\r\rEliminate both Tim and Ella and destroy the bag of gunpowder in order to hopefully bring an end to the monstrous company and ensure their products never make it into terrorist hands. Good luck as always. I’ll leave you to prepare.\r\rThis contract was made by Eclipse for the HITMAN Community Roadmap. Join our discord at https://hitman.community/discord for more information!",
