        "Description": "Elusive Target by Charlie_Farmer for hitmanforum.com\r\rGood afternoon, 47. Your target is charismatic billionaire playboy, Carrie Long.\r\rAfter his father’s death in 2014 Carrie has inherited his fathers holiday brochure company along with its fortunes. Carrie, since then has been going on holiday to exotic destinations across the globe, he is currently staying at Haven island spa and resort with his girlfriend Jacqueline Wealthy.\r\rAeon, our client, unfortunately suffered a great loss for this years global innovation race in Miami as they have had a sponsorship with the brochure company since the early 2000’s, but due to Carrie’s lack of interest for the racing team, he has instead decided to sponsor the Blue Seed racing team. Aeon has decided that if they cannot have the brochure company, Blue Seed certainly cannot as this will be a massive leg up for them.\rrAn added complication is Carrie Long’s girlfriend, Jacqueline Wealthy, the daughter of the CEO of Aeon, Carrie however doesn’t know this complication, so do not eliminate her. \r\rMake sure to cut his holiday short, 47. Good luck as always.",
